 # Welcome to my FortiConfigurator :)

The main goal of my code is that you can "configure" your Fortigate with only a few clicks. Or if you're on the road (train) and offline, you can just run the code locally on your machine and make your config file entirely offline.

Then simply copy the config you generated and paste it in the CLI of your the Fortigate or let the Fortigate start from the config file you generated. its that simple.

I also wanted to implement the other Fortigate products to be configurable from my web app in the near future.

I have no professional coding experience, but I like to code Web apps with React JS in my free time.
I hope my work can serve someone else. This tool is also online at [https://forticonfigurator.com] Feel free to help me make the code better if you like.

## Configuration availible for:

Fortigate 40F
Fortigate 60F

### `Function "Copy"`

When you're finished setting up the config file, you can copy it by clicking the "Copy" icon.

### `Function "Download"`

If you click on the Download icon the config will be downloaded locally to your machine as a TXT File.

### `Function "Send by Mail"`

If you click on the Mail Icon, your prefered Mail System will open up so you can paste the code or attach the downloaded file and send it to someone by mail.
